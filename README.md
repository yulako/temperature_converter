<!-- - As hinted in the previous item, please include a README file to explain not only how to build the app, but also the solution that you used. Make sure to include the description on the rationale behind the UI design and the application architecture. It would also be good to explain how you came to the decision on which tools or framework to use. Please do not take this part lightly. It is a very important part of the solution, as written communication is an important part of remote work. 

- You will also be required to provide a URL to the page where the finished application is running. As this is a single page client side application, you can use any static host for this. We recommend that you use either GitHub Pages or Netlify as they allow you to host your app for free. However, it does not matter which service you use, as long as it allows us to interact with your finished application.

Please include the discussion for how you implemented the above requirement in the README file. As with the main solution, you should be able to explain the design and architectural decisions that led you to the final solution.
